# Lord of the Ring - School assignment
A simple one-page site to get myself acquainted with bootstrap 4, and mess around with some HTML/CSS. Nothing fancy.

## Getting Started

To run the project on your local machine, simply clone the repo and run index.html with your favorite browser!

### Live version of the website

The site is hosted on github pages: https://dimibatch.github.io/Lord-of-The-Ring-themed-Site-unfinished/
